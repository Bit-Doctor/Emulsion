# Emulsion: a go emulator
**Emulsion** is pet project meant to learn emulation and go during my free time.

As such is not meant to be competing with standard emulator for playing games. The current goal is to succesfully emulate [CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8), other systems might come later.
